01. Write code to output releases directly to the page as text. Ugly but the boiler plate code is starting to work!
02. Write code to input releases in (a) bulk and (b) singularly.

LOW PRIORITY:
01. Leave this until I know a better way: generate body classes from macro; generate title from macro.
02. Database changes should happen depending on when they are needed. What exists should suffice for now.
03. Begin to use some test-suite to test the basic functionality I've created.
04. Find some way of making sure postgres is started on MacOSX. Consider using StackExchange since I've tried for ages already...
