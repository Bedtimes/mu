01. Fix my poor implementation of the repository pattern. The queries should be created inside the domain
    maybe using some kind of UserQueryFilter, etc...
    The repository should only have the following methods: create, update, delete, query
    -- and maybe some query helpers. ;)
    More importantly read the SQLAlchemy tutorials and make a decision!
02. Write code to output releases directly to the page as text. Ugly but the boiler plate code is starting to work!

LOW PRIORITY:
01. Leave this until I know a better way: generate body classes from macro; generate title from macro.
02. Database changes should happen depending on when they are needed. What exists should suffice for now.
