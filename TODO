01. Alter the database to allow:
    a. works to contain multiple releases... ;)
    b. uuid to be a key
    c. email to be properly unique and to give the correct error message if there is a duplicate. ;)
02. Continue writing semantic html until we have a good template making use of inheritance. :)
03. Write code to output releases directly to the page as text. Ugly but the boiler plate code is starting to work!
