01. Add comments; remove objects and patterns when they are not required. It's just bloat and there is no type safety to worry about anyway.
03. Think about how to separate services and follow 12 factor web app way. Can we use RabbitMQ/Celery to separate these. When?
04. Create some Flask test-suites.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05. Update code to output releases directly to the page as text. Ugly but the boiler plate code is starting to work!
06. Update code to input releases in (a) bulk and (b) singularly.
07. Think simplicity of twitter in style and in function. How basic can I make it? Draw a mockup.
