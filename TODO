01. Pivot: can we change products to actions of outputting a product? Can we remove the word Content from places. This allows us to track data other than media in the future: rumours of all types.
02. Are we able to search on PickleType. No? Can we search on fuzzy temporal data? It would be good if we could. What maths do we use for the certainty?
03. Write code to output releases directly to the page as text. Ugly but the boiler plate code is starting to work!
04. Write code to input releases in (a) bulk and (b) singularly.

LOW PRIORITY:
01. Leave this until I know a better way: generate body classes from macro; generate title from macro.
02. Database changes should happen depending on when they are needed. What exists should suffice for now.
03. Begin to use some test-suite to test the basic functionality I've created.
04. Find some way of making sure postgres is started on MacOSX. Consider using StackExchange since I've tried for ages already...
