01. The database has now changed.
    Make sure code reflects this.
And then:
03. Update code to output releases directly to the page as text. Ugly but the boiler plate code is starting to work!
04. Update code to input releases in (a) bulk and (b) singularly.
05. Think simplicity of twitter in style and in function. How basic can I make it? Draw a mockup.

LOW PRIORITY:
01. Leave this until I know a better way: generate body classes from macro; generate title from macro.
02. Begin to use some test-suite to test the basic functionality I've created.
