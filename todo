00. Change database a tiny bit for less redundancy;
    better handling of content_authors;
    and better, simpler and more complete add_product.
01. Update code to output releases directly to the page as text. Ugly but the boiler plate code is starting to work!
SELECT
  p.product_id,
  p.title,
  pt.name AS product_type,
  ps.name AS product_status,
  pm.name AS product_medium,
  p.created,
  w.work_id,
  w.title AS work_title,
  e.event_id,
  et.name AS event_type,
  e.certainty,
  e.predicted_start_release_date,
  e.predicted_end_release_date,
  e.predicted_textual_release_date
FROM
  "Product" AS p
  LEFT JOIN "ProductMedium" AS pm ON p.product_medium_id = pm.product_medium_id
  LEFT JOIN "ProductStatus" AS ps ON p.product_status_id = ps.product_status_id
  LEFT JOIN "ProductType" AS pt ON p.product_type_id = pt.product_type_id
  LEFT JOIN "Work" AS w ON p.work_id = w.work_id
  LEFT JOIN "Event" AS e ON p.event_id = e.event_id
  LEFT JOIN "EventType" AS et ON e.event_type_id = et.event_type_id;
02. Update code to input releases in (a) bulk and (b) singularly.

01. Add comments.
02. Think about how to separate services and follow 12 factor web app way. ZeroRFC?
03. Create unit tests.
04. Use something else other than service_name and version. Follow a standard!
